                <li><h4>When HTML5 has become a standard?</h4>
                    W3C endorses the Web development specification as an official standard. At long last, HTML5 today reached the official Recommendation stage, meaning the World Wide Web Consortium finally endorsed it as an official standard, even as the technology already is in use in browsers.</li>
                <li><h4> What is a difference between W3C HTML5 and WHATWG HTML Living Standard?</h4>
                    The W3C "HTML5" standard was snapshot-based (HTML5, HTML5. 1, etc.) and static, while the WHATWG "HTML living standard" is continually updated</li>
                <li><h4>Comment on semantic and presentational markup. Why presentational markup is considered deprecated now? </h4>
                    Over the years, our way of thinking about HTML has evolved. Originally, it was an all-purpose markup language for displaying and styling content online.
                    Over time, as external stylesheets became more of a thing, it began to make more sense to think about web development differently — as a separation of concerns where HTML defines the content of a page, and CSS handles the presentation of it.</li>
                <li><h4> How you can check browser support for particular tag or attribute?</h4>
                    You can use CSS selectors to target any element on a web page. Every single element is uniquely positioned in the document object model (DOM), and thus selectors can be used to find even the most generic elements.</li>
                <li><h4> What are the audio and video formats, officially supported by HTML standard? What happens if you use other format? </h4>
                    Only MP3, WAV, and Ogg audio are supported by the HTML standard. If you will use other format it won’t work because it is not suitable for HTML.</li>
